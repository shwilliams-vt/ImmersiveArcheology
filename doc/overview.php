    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
    Our project, Immersive Archeology, seeks to provide archeologists the ability to upload dig sites and artifact metadata to be experienced in immersive and interactive 3D environments. We refer to these special archeologists as "clients", who are a subset of "users" who wish to experience the interactive and immersive 3D environments.

<h3>Stack</h3>
<p>
    We use an AMP stack to host our project (Apache, MySQL and PHP). We develop locally with <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>, a free software that allows users to run a local loopback AMP stack/server. We are currently hosting our website with <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000Webhost</a>, a free web hosting service with some limitations but enough for our project to be accessed publicly on the web, at https://immersive-archeology.000webhostapp.com/
